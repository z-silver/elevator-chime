Elevator Chime is a Zig reimplementation of [Chime](https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/chime).

Currently, we don't have syscalls. More test cases need to be written. There isn't a proper main function. We cannot parse source code, nor can we directly load compiled binaries.

`zig build test` will execute the triangle numbers and short multiplication example programs.

`zig build run` will execute the read syscall example program.

Written against Zig version `0.12.1`.
