Elevator Chime is a Zig reimplementation of [Chime](https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/chime).

`zig build test` executes the triangle numbers and short multiplication example programs.

`zig build chaff` reads a chaff assembly file from stdin, compiles it and writes it to stdout.

`zig build run -- <compiled-file>` executes a binary image.

Written against Zig version `0.13.0`.
