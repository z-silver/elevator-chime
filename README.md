Elevator Chime is a Zig reimplementation of [Chime](https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/chime).

Currently, we don't have syscalls. More test cases need to be written. There isn't a proper main function.

The only way to use this at the moment is to run `zig build test` from the command line.

Written against Zig version `0.11.0`.
